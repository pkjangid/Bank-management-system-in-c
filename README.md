# Bank-management-system-in-c
Here is a project we developed as a mini project in the C bank management system during our first semester; it is complete and totally error-free. This project is focused on customer account services in banks, so it is named “Customer Account Bank Management System”.  Here, you can create a new account, update information of an existing account, view and manage transactions, check the details of an existing account, remove existing account and view customers’ list.
